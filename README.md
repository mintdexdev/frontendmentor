### The challenge

In all the projects Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My Process

### Built with

- Core- ```HTML```, ```CSS```, ```JavaScript```
- Frontend Library- ```React```
- CSS Framework- ```Tailwindcss```
- Animation Library- ```GSAP```, ```Motion``` 
- State Management- ```Redux```
- Rotuer handle- ```React Router```
- Utility library- ```SwiperJs``` 

### What I learned

Learnt Everything about web dev from the ground up so whole projects are always for something new
and the tech mentioned in [built in](#built-in) section are completely from scratch

### Continued development

There will be no more projects in near future beacuse I have learnt everything i can now I stepped into real world Projects and I will make side projects for practice and not from a single source
